## 🌟 What Drives Me

I'm deeply passionate about building tools that solve real problems.
Whether it's a mini-game for fun or a developer platform that boosts productivity — I enjoy taking an idea from scratch and making it real.

I believe in:

* **Simplicity with impact** — great tools don’t have to be complex.
* **Learning through building** — every project is a step toward mastery.
* **Empowering others** — through code, open source, and collaboration.

💡 My dream is to keep creating products that people love to use, and to contribute to the future of tech as both a developer and a problem solver.
